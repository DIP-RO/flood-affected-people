        <p>As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its history. Over a
            hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation is getting
            even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain and rush of waters from
            the rivers.
            The Bangladeshi government is trying their best to help provide in this situation</p>

                    Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,

                    prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few
                    days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.

                <p class="up7">Flooding has killed 68 people in Bangladesh, the majority of them in the country's Sylhet
                    region, and left approximately 4.5 million stranded, according to Reuters. Houses and livelihoods
                    have been swept away. Waterborne illnesses, including skin infections and diarrheal disease, quickly
                    spread.Houses and business organisations in different areas of Sylhet city including Shahjalal
                    Uposhohor, Teroratan, Sobhani Ghat, and Kalighat are submerged, disrupting road communication in the
                    areas. Water has also entered different areas of Sunamganj municipal town. Due to the flooding, many
                    educational institutions have closed in the district. Earlier in mid-May, Sylhet saw its worst flood
                    in 18 years. Most of the 12 upazilas and towns in the district were inundated and electricity, gas,
                    and water supply were disrupted at that time. Now the floods have hit Sylhet again. </p>
