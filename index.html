        <p>As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its history. Over a
            hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation is getting
            even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain and rush of waters from
            the rivers.
            The Bangladeshi government is trying their best to help provide in this situation</p>

                <p class="para">
                    Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being
                    prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few
                    days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.
